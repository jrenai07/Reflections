When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When you want to share your work with others or when you are working on group project that all participants need access too. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because the automatic update might miss something or get confused as to which repository is must up to date. It's best to do it yourself as opposed to having the computer trying to interpret what you are trying to accomplish. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork is a clone of a github repository that you don't have permission to edit and so you clone it to your own github profile. A clone is the same thing but it is done on your own terminal or from your own github repository and not from someone elses and it is done on your local computer. Branches are different repositories of your code that have slight changes. Aka different versions of your master code representing slight changes or the work of other collaborators. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can review the changes that have been made with out the need of wifi access and review them before merging them together. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Not sure actually. Maybe using one of the other forms of version control mentioned at the beginning of the course like dropbox or google drive. Those seem like they would be harder to use because they don't have as many features for developers like git and github.
